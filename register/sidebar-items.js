This allows a peripheral to do a single read on a register, and then check which bits are set without having to do a full MMIO read each time. It also allows the value of the register to be \"cached\" in case the peripheral driver needs to clear the register in hardware yet still be able to check the bits."]],"trait":[["IntLike","IntLike properties needed to read/write/modify a register."],["RegisterLongName","Descriptive name for each register."],["TryFromValue","Conversion of raw register value into enumerated values member.
